# Tutorial on Machine Learning for Intelligent Mobile User Interfaces using TensorFlow
One key feature of TensorFlow includes the possibility to compile the trained model to run efficiently on mobile phones. This enables a wide range of opportunities for researchers and developers. In this tutorial, we teach attendees two basic steps to run neural networks on a mobile phone: Firstly, we will teach how to develop neural network architectures and train them in TensorFlow. Secondly, we show the process to run the trained models on a mobile phone.

The compiled Android app to test the model trained from Step 1:  [Android Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.interactionlab.tutorial_mobile_example)
